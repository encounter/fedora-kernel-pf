Linux 4.5 rebase notes:

- Check on status of drm-i915-turn-off-wc-mmaps.patch (Should be okay to remove in F24, but not F22 or F23)
- Check on status of disabled ZONE_DMA (They can now coexist with ZONE_DEVICE)
- Check on status of CONFIG_DW_DMAC_CORE ( Built-in DW_DMAC for now, revisit later)

Linux 4.4 rebase notes:

CONFIG_RTL8XXXU_UNTESTED should be turned off. Great for rawhide, not for stable
